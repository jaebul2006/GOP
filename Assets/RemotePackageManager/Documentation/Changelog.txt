iOS downloading package bugfix and some small improvements.

3.0

UNITY 5 SUPPORT ADDED!!
Finally, it is now possible to use the new enhanced Asset Bundle workflow that comes with Unity5 (more info at http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/EnhancedAssetBundle.html)
RemotePackageManager now integrates itself on top of the new Unity5 API (fear not as Unity4 users are still able to use it the old way!)

*IMPORTANT*
If you are a Unity5 user, you should define/create/assign Asset Bundles through the default inspector located at the bottom ("AssetLabels").
Then you'll be able to *assign*, *build* and *upload* them to your servers.
Also, now it is not necessary anymore to manually set their dependencies as Unity5 should do that automagically for you ;)

You can find more info regarding the new workflow here: http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BuildingAssetBundles5x.html
